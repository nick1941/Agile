# What is Agile?

Agile is a solution that consists of programming examples and sample code based on the book
_Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#_ by Robert C. Martin and Micah Martin.

It currently contains three projects under construction:

*  BowlingGame

*  GameTest

*  FrameTest

## BowlingGame

BowlingGame is a project to programmatically score a bowling game.  It is being built up
incrementally by a fictional team of two people collaborating on the project, designing and
improving it with a goal to producing a solid efficient application.

It currently contains four classes:

* Program - currently a do-nothing containing an empty Main method

* Frame - currently only used by the FrameTest project (see below)

* Scorer - a class used to score frames

* Game - the overall class for scoring the game

## FrameTest

FrameTest is a Microsoft Unit Test project for testing the Frame class.  This was used early
in the solution development, but is of no relevance now.

## GameTest

GameTest is a Microsoft Unit Test project for testing the Game class.

## In Progress

As mentioned above, this solution is still under development and is not yet complete.
