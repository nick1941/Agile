# What is Agile?

Agile is a solution that consists of programming examples and sample code based on the book
_Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#_ by Robert C. Martin and Micah Martin.

It currently contains three projects:

*  BowlingGame

*  GameTest

## BowlingGame

BowlingGame is a project to programmatically score a bowling game.  It was built up in the book
incrementally by a fictional team of two people collaborating on the project, designing and
improving it with a goal to producing a solid efficient application.

It contains three classes:

* Program - a console application that demonstrates how to score a bowling game.

* Scorer - a class used to score frames

* Game - the overall class for scoring the game


## GameTest

GameTest is a Microsoft Unit Test project for testing the Game class.
